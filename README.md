# CSCI544 Group 15 - NLP for Stock Trend Forecasting

We developped/ran our project on Google CoLab, thus, to run this project successfully, make sure to specify the correct path to your drive before running our code. To be more specific, after clone/download our source code to CoLab, modify and run the following code as the first cell of each notebooks:

```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
%cd '/content/drive/<your drive>/csci544-project'
```
- `Group15_NLP_Stock_Forecasting_with_oecd.ipynb` contains the step-by-step work of our project.
- `Group15_NLP_Stock_Forecasting_without_oecd.ipynb` contains similar work of above but used a dataset without OECD indicators.
- `OECD_data_processing.ipynb` is for data pre-processing.
